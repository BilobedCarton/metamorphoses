                        Mary Zimmerman is an award-winning
                        director and playwright known for her
                        adaptations of classic works of literature
                        and her unique style of creating theatre.
                        <br/> <br/>
                        Zimmerman is unique in not only writing
                        adaptations of plays, but continuing on
                        in the process and directing them as
                        well. She begins the rehearsal process
                        without a script and begins to write bit
                        by bit based on the interactions of the
                        actors during rehearsals.
